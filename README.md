# 👋 Hi, I’m Jacob Fahrnbach

🎯 **Self-taught full-stack developer** with over 4,800 hours dedicated to learning software engineering, cloud, and web development — and another 3,700+ in digital art, design, and creative tools. I learned to code not just for the love of building, but because I believe that free access to knowledge changes lives — it changed mine.

I’m passionate about the intersection of creativity and code — from expressive frontends to optimized backends — and I’m currently diving deeper into Python and AI development.

	My ultimate goal? 
 	To contribute to Technology that makes the world more accessible, more creative, and more kind.
