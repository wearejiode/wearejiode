👋 Hi, I’m Jacob Fahrnbach

🎯 I’m a self-taught full-stack developer with over a **decade** of study in software engineering, cloud, and web development — 4,800+ hours on software and systems work, and 3,700+ hours on digital art, design, and creative work.

I didn’t just learn to code to build things — I learned because I believe technology should empower everyone. Free access to knowledge changed my life, and I want to pay that forward.

I’m passionate about the intersection of creativity and code — from expressive frontends to efficient backends — and I’m currently diving deeper into Python and AI development.

### 💡 My ultimate goal? To build technology that makes the world more accessible, equitable, and kind — tools that help people connect, create, and thrive.
